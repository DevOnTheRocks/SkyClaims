# Configuration

SkyClaims is primarily configured using a permissions plugin giving the most flexibility to have different settings
for different players and/or groups.

## [Options](options.md)
Settings for most of SkyClaims' features can be set using permission options _(luckperms meta)_
  
## [Permissions](https://github.com/DevOnTheRocks/SkyClaims/blob/sponge/api-7/src/main/java/net/mohron/skyclaims/permissions/Permissions.java)
Access to commands, features, as well as a few on/off configurations are available as traditional permissions

## File
The config file contains a handful of global settings that don't benefit from player or group settings. 
The config file can be found in `config/skyclaims/skyclaims.conf`.
