# SkyClaims [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mohron/SkyClaims.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/Mohron/SkyClaims)
SkyClaims is a plugin/addon for SkyBlock servers that run [GriefPrevention](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/griefprevention-official-thread/1123) for protection.
Instead of reinventing the wheel and adding custom protection for islands, SkyClaims will implement claims from one of Sponge's most powerful plugins,  GriefPrevention!
With this design, nearly every GriefPrevention feature will be available to players for managing their islands.

This plugin is in Beta but I expect to have a release soon™. Live support for current builds is available through [Discord](https://discord.gg/EkVQycV)! Here's some of what is under development or planned for SkyClaims:

- Allow complete control of command usage with granular permissions (ie specific biomes for setbiome)
- Allow automatic creation of Islands and their encompassing claim
- Allow multiple starter island designs via Sponge schematics
- Configurable island layouts (linear & spiral planned)
- Islands that can automatically grow
- Isolation of islands to their own Minecraft region file
- Allow spawn/tp on your island at a configurable location 
- Allow use of GriefPrevention trust commands to work in teams
- Allow changing the biome of a block, chunk or entire island
- Add an island messaging channel so you can chat within your island _(for after release)_

### Required Plugins
- [GriefPrevention](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/griefprevention-official-thread/1123) -  1.10.2-2.3.0.229+

### More details are available on our [Wiki](https://github.com/DevOnTheRocks/SkyClaims/wiki/).

### Plugin downloads are available on [Ore](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Mohron/SkyClaims/).
