SkyClaims is a plugin for SkyBlock servers that run [GriefPrevention](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/griefprevention-official-thread/1123) for protection.
Instead of reinventing the wheel and adding custom protection for islands, SkyClaims will implement claims from one of Sponge's most powerful plugins, GriefPrevention!
With this design, nearly every GriefPrevention feature will be available to players for managing their islands.

This plugin is in Beta. Live support is available for the latest builds through [Discord](https://discord.gg/EkVQycV)!

## Features

- [X] Complete control of command usage with granular permissions (ie specific biomes for setbiome)

- [X] Expanding islands using claim blocks
- [X] Isolation of islands to their own Minecraft region file
- [X] Allow spawn/tp on your island at a configurable location
